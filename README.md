# Neural Style Transfer: Nature Photos to Monet-style Paintings

## Overview
This project implements Neural Style Transfer (NST), a deep learning technique that combines the content of one image with the artistic style of another. Specifically, it transforms photos of natural scenes into artworks that resemble Monet paintings. Using the Monet2Photo dataset, this project demonstrates how to blend the structural content of natural photos with the distinctive brushstrokes, textures, and colors of Monet's artistic style.

## Example Output
- Content Image: A natural photo of a landscape.
- Style Image: A Monet painting with distinctive brushstrokes and colors.
- Generated Image: The landscape photo transformed to resemble a Monet painting.
